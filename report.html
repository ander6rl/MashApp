This app combines the Cat API and the Wikipedia API

It has a dropdown menu where you can choose a cat breed and it displays info from cat api and from the first wikipedia paragraph of the cat.
It also has a search function where you can search by name and then you can select breeds and bring up their page.

The website is responsive, going to a hamburger for the dropdown and the search when in mobile.
